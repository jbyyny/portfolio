                <h2>Senior Principal UX Designer</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2">NEED TO REVISIT THIS CONTENT!! I am a multi-platform experience designer with over 12 years of experience. My background includes a degree in business marketing, art direction in direct advertising and an MFA in Media Design prior to my focus on interactive experiences. I am a system thinker and get most excited about brainstroming and creating strategic solutions with designers, product and engineer partners. Designing and developing an experience that is logical, efficient and perhaps a bit serenditpitous is exciting and rewarding. I design all phases of a project including end-to-end product design.</div>

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2">Experience Design is everywhere. From a movie poster to your text interface to a vacation at Disneyland, it's all designed. My strength is designing UI for web and mobile experiences, but I also love thinking big picture strategy and designing complete systems for the right content in the right context. Additionally, I find brands and the psychology of users interacting with brands intriguing. I spent time working in advertising which blended both brands and experiences. My undergrad is in business/marketing. This plus an MFA in Media Design has become an unanticipated useful combination.</div>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2"> There is never just one right answer to any user interface design. In fact there may be 100 different ways it needs to be explored before solved and then validated by target users. Logic and familiar interaction patterns and data informed design should heavily influence the designed experience.</div>
