/*this is an example of a class name that i made up*/

.box {
    background-color: #fff; /*this is the background color of the box*/
    color: #000; /*this is the color of the font*/
    width: 320px;
    height: 332px;
    padding: 30px;
}

.nav {
    background-color: #ccc;

.nav ul {
    list-style: none; /*this gets rid of the bullets*/

h1 {
    font-size: 30px;
