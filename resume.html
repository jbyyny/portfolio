                    <div class="jobs-info2">I am a multi-platform experience designer with over 12 years of experience. My background includes a degree in business marketing, art direction in direct advertising and an MFA in Media Design prior to my focus on interactive experiences. I am a system thinker and get most excited about brainstroming and creating strategic solutions with designers, product and engineer partners. Designing and developing an experience that is logical, efficient and perhaps a bit serenditpitous is exciting and rewarding. I design all phases of a project including end-to-end product design.</div>
