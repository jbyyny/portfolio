                <ul>
                    <li>I am a Senior Principal Experience Designer. UX and interactive experiences are what I get most excited about and have been focusing on for the past 12 years.</li>
                    <li>I find leading design the process of a product design cycle both a great challenge and best use of my experience.</li>
                    <li>My favorite part of the design process is ideation and brainstorming, followed by making it. I believe its possible to find sweet spots when merging dreamt up ideas with realistic business requirements.</li>
                    <li>My approach to UX design is business minded and goal driven with space to play and dream.</li>
                    <li>I am a strategic and holistic thinker. I believe innovation, intuition and curiosity play into solving simple and complex interactive problems.</li>
                    <li>I work closely with design teammates and partner with engineering and product leads. Quick explorations and ongoing communication with the team allows for faster iterations.</li>
                    <li>There is never just one right answer to any user interface design. In fact there may be 100 different ways it needs to be explored before solved, and then validated by target users.</li>
                    <li>Prior to introducing a new idea, make a basic but well-designed visual or prototype for the team to understand your vision. This illustrates your WHAT IF thinking and allows for conversation and iteration.</li>
                    <li>Being ahead of schedule is a goal and I am quick to guide immediate focus toward anything that may block teammates.</li>
                    <li>I believe all team members (design, product and engineering) have great ideas and inherently understand basic principles of UX.</li>
                    <li>When an established experience calls for an overhaul, the challenge is to bring that  product to perform closer to its greatest potential given what we know today and where the product should go tomorrow.</li>
                    <li>I believe technology has enhanced our lives tremendously, yet want it to be less effort for people everyday. I also believe technology should evolve following human interaction patterns, rather than humans having to learn new technological interaction paradigms.</li>
                    <li>Logic is a core principal of UX. So is low effort for the user.</li>
                    <li>User testing and data-informed design are important, but are not the only drivers of change.</li>
                    <li>UX means being an empathetic advocate for the user.</li>
                    <li>If it's hard to explain, it needs to be rethought.</li>
                    <li>If I can help make an experience smart, ubiquitous, delightful, addictive and serendipitous for many users, I have succeeded.</li>
                    <li>As an experience designer I love to lead. I love to mentor. I love to think. I love to invent. I love to design. And I love to launch.</li>
