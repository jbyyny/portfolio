ABOUT ME
[avatar] Experience Design is everywhere. From a movie poster to your text interface to a vacation at Disneyland, it's all designed. My strength is designing UI for web experiences, but I also love thinking big picture strategy and about designing complete systems for the right content in the right context. I also enjoy thinking about brands. I spent time working in advertising which blended both brands and experiences. My undergrad is in business/marketing. This plus an MFA in Media Design has become an unanticipated useful combination.

PERSONAL ESCAPE
Running, skiing and as much as I can do outdoors. I live in Colorado. Go figure.

DREAM JOB
I'd love to invent something or be part of a team that invents and launches something major.
Like on the scale of Google or Facebook. That kind of major. What's the next big thing?
And even more exciting, the next big thing after that? And it doesn't have to be a web
experience. It will likely draw on metaphors and familiar human patterns.
