                <h2>Experience Design</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2">Experience Design is everywhere. From a movie poster to your text interface to a vacation at Disneyland, it's all designed. My strength is designing UI for web and mobile experiences, but I also love thinking big picture strategy and designing complete systems for the right content in the right context. Additionally, I find brands and the psychology of users interacting with brands intriguing. I spent time working in advertising which blended both brands and experiences. My undergrad is in business/marketing. This plus an MFA in Media Design has become an unanticipated useful combination.</div>
                
                <h2>Web References</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2">I'm quoted on this treehouse blog post [link] I'm also quoted on this treehouse blog post [link]</div>

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2">There is never just one right answer to any user interface design. In fact there may be 100 different ways it needs to be explored before solved and then validated by target users. Logic and familiar interaction patterns and data informed design should heavily influence the designed experience.</div>

                <h2>Dream Job</h2>
                <div class="jobs-info2">I'd love to invent something or be part of a team that invents and launches something major. Like on the scale of Google or Facebook. That kind of major. What's the next big thing? And even more exciting, the next big thing after that? And it doesn't have to be a we experience. It will likely draw on metaphors and familiar human patterns.</div>
